        <p>Six Hats thinking for discussion and thinking - seems quite useful for through exploration. My first comment is that the framework is issue focused and finding the best resolution to an issue - good for lots of situations but may not be loving when the issue less important to the people in the issue.

<hr><p>UI Interaction in Plone - The publication state is more significant for a content items permissions then the sharing tab. Meaning that a user might click on the sharing tab for a published item - uncheck the "inherit permissions" tick box and then click "View" for the group that they are intending to restrict permissions not realising that their intention to restrict is trumped by the publication state of the item. The sharing tab should not allow or at least give warning when you try to grant permissions to a group or user who already has that permission. Or the publication state should be more clearly assosiated with the permissions model... perhaps even making the sharing tab labeled - "publication and sharing" and displaying the publication implications to the permissions in the tab.</p>
