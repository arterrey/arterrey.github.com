$ git commit --amend

Went to a squiz presentation (with free breakfast). Interesting talk on "YOU GET WHAT YOU DESIGN: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF USER EXPERIENCE"
</p>

Things learnt:
<ul>
  <li>Attention as an element of UX design - questions like
  "am I able to direct my attention to a particular aspect of the site",
  "can I isolate what I'm looking for", (some other aspect which I can't recall.. paying attention??)
  
   </li>
   <li>Recognition is far better then recall - asking people to recall things is harder. Sites need to place little domands on memory.</li>
   
   <li>
     UX elements need to support the content/message rather then distract from it. Large impressive backgrounds or parralax bagrounds were given as an example that are good 
     when they support, but are bad when they make it difficult to find the call to action etc.
   </li>
   
   <li>
     links that turn pupple when clicked are good UI because it helps the user know where they have been
   </li>
   
   <li>
     People come to a site to "find what they are looking for" or "compleate some task"
   </li>
   
</ul>

Getting a stack trace from your zope instances which have lock-up can be done by sending SIGUSR1 to the zope process.
A stack trace for all threads will be printed to stdout. This is documented by reading the code :( but retrospectivly
I also googled it and found it in the Change log. It is now here for everyone to know.

        <p>opinion: Your email provider should not be giving your email for free</p>
        
        <p>
          For something so so important, you should at least have the a relationship with your email provider
          for which you are a customor and they are responsible to you, otherwise running your own email service
          is a good options too.

<p>Initial thoughts on structuring this site is to just have only one story/page like it is now - but no content images just text.</p>

<hr><p><strong>Six Hats</strong> thinking for discussion and thinking - seems quite useful for through exploration. My first comment is that the framework is issue focused and finding the best resolution to an issue - good for lots of situations but may not be loving when the issue less important to the people in the issue.

<hr><p>UI Interaction in Plone - The publication state is more significant for a content items permissions then the sharing tab. Meaning that a user might click on the sharing tab for a published item - uncheck the "inherit permissions" tick box and then click "View" for the group that they are intending to restrict permissions not realising that their intention to restrict is trumped by the publication state of the item. The sharing tab should not allow or at least give warning when you try to grant permissions to a group or user who already has that permission. Or the publication state should be more clearly assosiated with the permissions model... perhaps even making the sharing tab labeled - "publication and sharing" and displaying the publication implications to the permissions in the tab.</p>
