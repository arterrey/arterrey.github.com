Will need to restructure my repos because Nikola outputs to a sub directory and github pages doesn't seem to support having a separate root dir.\r\n\r\nInitial thoughts on structuring this site is to just have only one story/page like it is now - but no content images just text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n--Marker-- 2013-03-28\r\n\r\n***\r\nAnother idea - A **desktop windowing system** where the windows do not reorder but rather - clicking on a window underneath lifts the windows above it off the screen.\r\n\r\n***\r\n**An advanced search engine** I would really like (I would love to write it): Were indexes in the search engine are exposed as well as a defined query language API which can be used - I would pay for it.. I want a search engine with technical ability and is not pretending to be too smart and read my mind.\r\n***\r\nThis is page is probably the enemy of search engines. and aggregates. sorry, it is only really for my own use.

Meaning that a user might click on the sharing tab for a published item - uncheck the \"inherit permissions\" tick box and then click \"View\" for the group that they are intending to restrict permissions not realising that their intention to restrict is trumped by the publication state of the item. The sharing tab should not allow or at least give warning when you try to grant permissions to a group or user who already has that permission. Or the publication state should be more clearly assosiated with the permissions model... perhaps even making the sharing tab labeled - \"publication and sharing\" and displaying the publication implications to the permissions in the tab.\r\n***\r\n--Marker-- 2013-03-26\r\n***","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
