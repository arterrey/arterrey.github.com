Meaning that a user might click on the sharing tab for a published item - uncheck the \"inherit permissions\" tick box and then click \"View\" for the group that they are intending to restrict permissions not realising that their intention to restrict is trumped by the publication state of the item. The sharing tab should not allow or at least give warning when you try to grant permissions to a group or user who already has that permission. Or the publication state should be more clearly assosiated with the permissions model... perhaps even making the sharing tab labeled - \"publication and sharing\" and displaying the publication implications to the permissions in the tab.\r\n***\r\n--Marker-- 2013-03-26\r\n***","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
